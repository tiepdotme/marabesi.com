Ubuntu 19.04/19.10 as default comes with MySQL 8.0 as it's default version to work with.
Projects that need to use a 5.* version might run into problems in the downgrade
process. This post aims to guide the installation of MySQL 5.7 on ubuntu 19.04
and ubuntu 19.10.

After trying to set up MySQL following different sources **[1][2]** and fail over everyone,
an alternative might be the installation via .deb packages through the official
MySQL website, which is explored here.

## Set up

For this approach two assumptions take place, named:

1. Ubuntu 19 is up and running
2. Expertise handling commands via terminal (shell)

Lastly, if previous tries to install mysql 5.7 on ubuntu have been done, follow
the checklist:

1. Remove any MySQL installation via apt-get with the command: `sudo apt-get remove --purge mysql-server mysql-client mysql-common -y`
2. Remove old MySQL configuration from `/etc/mysql` with the command: `sudo rm -rf /etc/mysql`
3. Keep the apt in a clean state with the command `sudo apt-get update --fix-missing`

## Before installation check list

Ubuntu 19 comes with MySQL 8 as the defaul version to be installed, to double check that
run the following command in the command line `sudo apt list | grep mysql-server`,
the output should display the MySQL version current in use by apt.

```sh
mysql-server-8.0/eoan-updates,eoan-security 8.0.18-0ubuntu0.19.10.1 amd64
mysql-server-core-8.0/eoan-updates,eoan-security 8.0.18-0ubuntu0.19.10.1 amd64
mysql-server/eoan-updates,eoan-security 8.0.18-0ubuntu0.19.10.1 all
```

As expected, the version is 8. Even though previous references have shown how
to change the MySQL via apt **[1][2]** in early versions of ubuntu, this approach in my
experienced was not effective on ubuntu 19.*.

The explored solution might work on docker containers based on ubuntu 19.* as well.

## Installing MySQL via .deb files

The first step is to download MySQL 5.7 from [MySQL website](https://www.cyberpratibha.com/how-to-install-mysql-in-ubuntu) **[3]**,
chose the ubuntu version and hit the download button, in the next pase hit "No thanks, just start my download". It should the a few minutes
to download the entire package.

Disclaimer: this installation process requires a GUI, for terminal only installations
use the direct download solution to download the .tar file:

```sh
wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQL-5.7/mysql-server_5.7.28-1ubuntu19.04_amd64.deb-bundle.tar
```

Once the download has been completed, the .tar file should be availble in the
downlods folder (or in the folder where the `wget` was executed), for any standard browser
installation the folder will be `~/Downloads`. - For now on this is the path
refered, for custom directories replace `~/Downlodas` with the appropriated path.

In the terminal change the directory to where the downloaded file is located,
with the command:

```sh
cd ~/Downloads
```

Once in the folder, unpack all the files with the tar **[4]** command:

```sh
tar -xvf mysql-server_5.7.28-1ubuntu19.04_amd64.deb-bundle.tar
```

Once the command has run, the extracted files list should contain the MySQL 5.7.*
deb files:

```sh
mysql-client_5.7.28-1ubuntu19.04_amd64.deb
mysql-common_5.7.28-1ubuntu19.04_amd64.deb
mysql-community-client_5.7.28-1ubuntu19.04_amd64.deb
mysql-community-server_5.7.28-1ubuntu19.04_amd64.deb
mysql-community-source_5.7.28-1ubuntu19.04_amd64.deb
mysql-server_5.7.28-1ubuntu19.04_amd64.deb
mysql-testsuite_5.7.28-1ubuntu19.04_amd64.deb
mysql-community-test_5.7.28-1ubuntu19.04_amd64.deb
```

To prevent uneeded issues, the test packages can be removed as they aren't
required to install or run MySQL server. To remove those files run the
following command:

```sh
rm -rf mysql-testsuite_5.7.28-1ubuntu19.04_amd64.deb mysql-community-test_5.7.28-1ubuntu19.04_amd64.deb
```

The final command to execute the installation is:

```sh
dpkg -i mysql-*.deb
```

The command will select all files that start with `mysql-` that has .deb extention
and will start the installation process.

Once the command has completed execution, check MySQL server status with
the following command:

```sh
/etc/init.d/mysql status
```

Which in turn should output:

```sh
 * MySQL Community Server 5.7.28 is started
```

Usually the MySQL service starts by default after the installation - if this is
not the case the command `/etc/init.d/mysql start` can be used to start the
service.

## Troubleshooting

Errors related due the lack of dependent packages, usually can be fixed
running the command `sudo apt-get update --fix-missing` after the
error message. Ubuntu will try to install the missing dependencies automatically.

## EDIT: May 19 2020

Another approach to avoid the need to install MySQL on Ubuntu 19.04 or 19.10 is
to use the docker image - This solution applies to users that have the minimum
understanding of docker.

The following command, runs MySQL 5.7 on por 3306, without the need to install
it:

```sh
docker run --name mysql-5-7 --restart always -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -d mysql:5.7
```

Docker will create a MySQL container running on port 3306 with the `root` user and
the `secret` password.
