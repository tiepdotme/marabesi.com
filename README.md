# Serving with docker

Disclaimer: [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install) must be installed as well
as [docker-compode](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install).

As a pre-configuration step (in linux), the number of watchers must be increased, as explained
[here](https://github.com/guard/listen/wiki/Increasing-the-amount-of-inotify-watchers)


The docker setup comes with two options to expose the blog ports, and they are
as follows:

```
BLOG_PORT=4000
BLOG_DEBUG=35729
```

The snippet above should be placed in a `.env` file in the root of the repository.
Once the command has been finished, the website will be available on localhost
port 4000.

Once the file has been created, the following command is used to set up the
local environment:

```
docker-compose up
```
