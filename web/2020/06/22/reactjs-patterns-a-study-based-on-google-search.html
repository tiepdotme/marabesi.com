  <h1>ReactJs patterns - A study based on google search</h1>

  <main class="mb-5">
    <p>ReactJS is among one of the most used javascript library according to GitHub it is
one of the mos popular started repository. Given its popularity it is expected
that the community around it will start to develop techniques, guides and tutorials
around patterns.</p>

<p>Inspired by the software systematic review literature paper
<a class="citation" href="#tamburri2020success">[1]</a>, that collects a broader
overview of the software engineering success and failure factors, this post has
the goal to answer the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Q1.</strong> What is the most popular ReactJS pattern?</li>
  <li><strong>Q2.</strong> What are the themes that appears related to the patterns?</li>
</ul>

<p>Opposed to the scientific method presented by the authors (the research was
conducted mining scientific bases, named: IEEE explorer, ACM digital library,
science direct, springer link, scopus and engineering village), this post is
a collection based on google search.</p>

<p>Besides the questions to be answered in this post, the aim is also to be a source
to access when in doubt of which reactjs pattern to learn first and also a guide
to help beginners to have a picture of the patterns that developers most talk
about.</p>

<h2 id="finding-reactjs-patterns-articles">Finding reactjs patterns articles</h2>

<p>Google blocks the crawling on search, in this case the approach taken was
the google custom search (https://stackoverflow.com/a/30041104/2258921). The custom
search (https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/using_rest) API allow
developers to use google search programatically, and works as google search,
the difference is that this integration allow calls programmatically.</p>

<p>The first interaction with the API showed a particular behavior that this service
has, as pointed by <a class="citation" href="#google_employee_search_results">[2]</a>,
the total number in the result is not the real number, it is an approximation.</p>

<p>The search string used for explore the first researching question, was “reactjs patterns”.
Searching for this string in google.com, in the first page is shown 904 results.
Executing the same query through the programmable search gives 161 results,
and mining the results through the API, gives 96 results. This behavior
is expected as pointed by <a class="citation" href="#google_employee_search_results">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>To mine the results a javascript file was developed, the script executes recursively
based on the number of pages that google returns till the last page of results
for a given search string. In total 96 links were found and saved to a XLS file <a class="citation" href="#google_search_results">[3]</a>
for further analysis described in the next section.</p>

<h2 id="mining-results">Mining results</h2>

<p>A manual analysis of the results was made in the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Removed results that does not have reactjs patterns discussions, such as explaining a
pattern or listing a pattern.</li>
  <li>Classify each search result into a category.</li>
</ol>

<p>For 1, a manual approach was taken to go through each item in the search result
to apply the exclusion criteria. As result 14 items were removed <a class="citation" href="#google_search_results">[3]</a> (the removed
content can be found in the tab “mined”).</p>

<p>For 2, the following categories were created to group the search results: book,
course, meetup, post, question, slides, video. The categories were generated
based on a manual review of each item.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Category</th>
      <th>Total</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>post</td>
      <td>66</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>course</td>
      <td>7</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>book</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>question</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>video</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>meetup</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>slides</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The category <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">post</code> is the most popular, followed by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">course</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">book</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">question</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">video</code> have the same number of items (2) and in the last two spots are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">meetup</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">slides</code>.</p>

<h2 id="analyzing-the-results">Analyzing the results</h2>

<p>This section dives into the results found, presents a brief explanation of each
item in the list. Therefore, this section does not cover the categories <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">question</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">meetup</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">video</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">slides</code> as they present less than three items.</p>

<h3 id="posts">Posts</h3>

<p>The post category is the most popular with 66, as a first exploration the posts
were read, and for each of them a pattern name was manually assigned, based on the content
of the post. Most of them have more the one pattern associated with it, for
example, the first post, in the list covered 22 patterns.</p>

<p>This process was repeated for each post in the list. Once the classification was done,
the word cloud <a class="citation" href="#word_cloud">[4]</a>
visualization was generated (the process is described in the next sentence).</p>

<p><a href="/artifacts/posts/2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search/word-cloud" target="_blank"><img src="/images/posts/2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search/word_cloud.png" alt="Word cloud generated based on the classification" title="Word cloud generated based on the classification, click to see the visualization" /></a></p>

<p>The raw classification was processed using the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Similar words were normalized, the word “component” and “components” were normalized
to the word without s (singular form), resulting in “component”</li>
  <li>Words with capital letter were normalized to use the lower case.</li>
  <li>Different words used with common mean were normalized, for example, the higher order component
is commonly used as HoC, the shorter version was used.</li>
</ol>

<p>The word cloud depicts the translation between the most cited patterns used in
the dataset. The most cited pattern is Component, followed by props taking into
consideration just a single word.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<p>This section dive deeper in the results depicted in the previous section, the
first sub section focus on <strong>Q1</strong> and the second section focuses on <strong>Q2</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="q1">Q1</h3>

<p>For <strong>Q1</strong>, based on the pure pattern classification the results point to the most popular pattern being the “component”,
followed by “props” which are the foundation of ReactJs, as everything is a component, and communication happens via props. A first hypothesis into this result is the repetition of those two patterns to explain more complex ones, for developers that are starting into the reactjs, components and props are the first principles to understand.</p>

<p><a href="/artifacts/posts/2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search/lollipop" target="_blank"><img src="/images/posts/2020-06-22-reactjs-patterns-a-study-based-on-google-search/lollipop.png" alt="lollipop graph" title="lollipop graph, top 10, click to see the visualization" /></a></p>

<p>In addition to that complex patterns such as hooks and higher order components appear surrounding the component and prop pattern. Those are the patterns which requires from the developer a previous understanding of props and components as they are more complex, which in turn, can lead to less content related to those patterns.</p>

<h3 id="q2">Q2</h3>

<p>For <strong>Q2</strong> the surrounding elements are the focus, so for example, terms like
best practices and design were found and are related to reactjs patterns.</p>

<!-- Code reuse, separate of concerns, readability, easy to maintain,-->
<p>As such, <a class="citation" href="#post_clean_code_dirty_code">[5]</a>,
entitled “Clean Code vs. Dirty Code: React Best Practices”, enumerates 14 sections
about best practices. Those sections are related to code standards, javascript
features, naming variables and also about industry standard to follow when coding
like DRY.</p>

<h2 id="related-work">Related work</h2>

<p>This section dives in the content of each post mined and group them in the
different patterns found. It is possible for the same post to appear in different
sections, as the content might explore more than one at time.</p>

<h3 id="container-component">Container component</h3>

<p><a class="citation" href="#post_react_patterns">[6]</a>
uses the Jason Bonta’s definition of the container component: the container component fetches data, and then
renders it’s corresponding sub component. That’s it. <a class="citation" href="#post_react_component_patterns">[7]</a> and <a class="citation" href="#post_simple_react_design_patterns_container_view">[8]</a> agrees on
the same definition as <a class="citation" href="#post_react_patterns">[6]</a>
and adds that, the container component is the place to connect to redux.</p>

<p>The following code (adapted from <a class="citation" href="#post_react_patterns">[6]</a>) depicts
the container component using class component. <a class="citation" href="#post_simple_react_patterns">[9]</a>
also offers a code example.</p>

<p><a class="citation" href="#post_implementing_the_container_pattern_using_react_hooks">[10]</a>
elaborates on the container component with hooks along side with a to-do list app that implements the pattern. Also the definition
followed was the same as <a class="citation" href="#post_react_patterns">[6]</a>, it
seems that there is a consensus that Jason Bonta defined the container component pattern
and developers point to him. <a class="citation" href="#post_introduction_to_react_design_patterns">[11]</a>
rates the container component as a pattern that provides: separation of concerns, it
is reusable and it is testable.</p>

<p><a class="citation" href="#post_the_react_redux_container_pattern">[12]</a> expands on
the idea that container component is awere of redux, the same
argument made by <a class="citation" href="#post_react_patterns">[6]</a>, but in
this case, the author gives “the internet” the credit to agree on that. <a class="citation" href="#post_2019_reactjs_best_practices">[13]</a> has somehow
a not so clean definition about container component, also the text mix HoC with
presentational components and other patterns.</p>

<h3 id="conditional-rendering">Conditional rendering</h3>

<p><a class="citation" href="#post_evolving_patterns_in_react">[14]</a>
gives his opinions on the conditional rendering pattern and also states that
it is a natural step for developers to separate logic from the actual return code (the code
given as example is a ternary if). As an alternative to the conditional
rendering, the author suggests to use the JSX alternative with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;&amp;</code>. <a class="citation" href="#post_react_conditional_rendering">[15]</a>
expands on the JSX alternatives for conditional rendering.</p>

<h3 id="compound-components">Compound Components</h3>

<p><a class="citation" href="#post_advanced_react_component_patterns">[16]</a> and
<a class="citation" href="#post_five_ways_to_advanced_react_patterns">[17]</a>
share the same definition, the compound components are components that are distinct, but does not work without
the other, they make sense together only. Furthermore, <a class="citation" href="#post_advanced_react_component_patterns">[16]</a> mentions the HTML
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">select</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">option</code> as an example of compound components. <a class="citation" href="#post_seven_patterns_by_example">[18]</a> uses
the compount component pattern to build a radio group component, which the user can select only one option
between the available options.</p>

<h3 id="decorated-component">Decorated component</h3>

<p>The decorated component is a pattern that does not not appear often,
<a class="citation" href="#post_patterns_for_testable_react_components">[19]</a>
demonstrates the decorated component as a way to decouple components, or even
to enhance component features, Redux uses the decorated component pattern
to enhance the component props.</p>

<p>Therefore, the decorated pattern can be used as a way to decouple the component
that fetch data with the one that actually uses the data. <a class="citation" href="#post_2019_reactjs_best_practices">[13]</a> states that
the decorated pattern is the same as HoC.</p>

<h3 id="higher-order-component">Higher-Order-Component</h3>

<p><a class="citation" href="#post_evolving_patterns_in_react">[14]</a> and
<a class="citation" href="#post_2019_reactjs_best_practices">[13]</a>
agree on the definition that HoC, in a sense that HoC are decorators. <a class="citation" href="#post_advanced_react_component_patterns">[16]</a> though, has an
argument that the HoC name is misnormer, which is based on his own thoughts.</p>

<p>A HoC takes a reactjs component enhances it and then returns the new enhanced
component to be used <a class="citation" href="#post_five_ways_to_advanced_react_patterns">[17]</a>
<a class="citation" href="#post_simple_react_patterns">[9]</a>
<a class="citation" href="#post_advanced_patterns_reactjs">[20]</a>
<a class="citation" href="#post_reactjs_in_patterns">[21]</a> 
<a class="citation" href="#post_higher_order_components">[22]</a>
<a class="citation" href="#post_react_component_types_a_complete_overview">[23]</a>.</p>

<p><a class="citation" href="#post_react_patterns_react_and_ramda">[24]</a> has a different
definition, which states that the HoC receives a component as an argument and returns
another component. This definition is weider than the previous one. Often the
HoC receives a component and enhance the same component functionality, and returns
the same camponent with added behavior, from <a class="citation" href="#post_react_patterns_react_and_ramda">[24]</a>
would be possible to receive A and then return B.</p>

<p>Therefore, <a class="citation" href="#post_patterns_for_data_fetching_in_react">[25]</a>
states that HoC is responsible to fetch data and then propagate to child components. This definition is an addition
to the previous agreed definition, but does not restrict the pattern to be used as data fetch only. <a class="citation" href="#post_5_react_data_fetching">[26]</a> adds that
the HoC is used to fetch data and also split data fetching from data presentation.
For the first time, the HoC is compared as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">container pattern</code> and not the 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">decorated component pattern</code>.</p>

<p><a class="citation" href="#post_how_advanced_react_patterns_changed_with_hooks">[27]</a>
explores the HoC in the new era of react hooks. <a class="citation" href="#post_patterns_style_composition">[28]</a> has no definition statement, though the content is followed with HoC
code examples.</p>

<h3 id="render-props--render-callback">Render Props / Render callback</h3>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">render props</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">render callback pattern</code> is used to render a given component
based on a function callback <a class="citation" href="#post_react_patterns">[6]</a>
<a class="citation" href="#post_five_ways_to_advanced_react_patterns">[17]</a>
<a class="citation" href="#post_react_component_patterns">[7]</a>
<a class="citation" href="#post_advanced_patterns_reactjs">[20]</a>
<a class="citation" href="#post_introduction_to_react_design_patterns">[11]</a>, or
as <a class="citation" href="#post_how_to_master_advanced_react_design_patterns">[29]</a> states,
instead of rendering the children (which is as common technique in reactjs), this pattern
renders the prop. Even though <a class="citation" href="#post_how_to_master_advanced_react_design_patterns">[29]</a> states that the render prop renders the prop, instead of the children, <a class="citation" href="#post_how_advanced_react_patterns_changed_with_hooks">[27]</a>,<a class="citation" href="#post_5_react_data_fetching">[26]</a> and <a class="citation" href="#post_common_i18n_patterns_in_react">[30]</a> describes the render prop
using the children explicitly.</p>

<p>Furthermore <a class="citation" href="#post_evolving_patterns_in_react">[14]</a>
states that the pattern render props and HoC are interchangeable. The term render callback is clearer in the intention
of the pattern, but the term, render props got more adoption from the
community <a class="citation" href="#post_react_patterns_render_callback">[31]</a>.
On the other hand <a class="citation" href="#post_simple_react_patterns">[9]</a>,
states that there is discution between the effectiveness of the pattern.</p>

<h3 id="provider--context">Provider / Context</h3>

<p>The provider pattern is used in libraries such as react-redux and react-router. The idea  behind the provider pattern is to avoid passing
props for each component in the three, instead, the pattern makes,
the prop available for all the tree that uses the provider regardless
of the tree depth <a class="citation" href="#post_advanced_react_component_patterns">[16]</a>. The
provider pattern is an answer for the problem called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">props-drilling</code> <a class="citation" href="#post_provider_pattern_in_react_using_react_context_api">[33]</a>
<a class="citation" href="#post_8_no_flux_strategies_for_react">[34]</a>.</p>

<p>The provider pattern is often related to reactjs context <a class="citation" href="#post_evolving_patterns_in_react">[14]</a> <a class="citation" href="#post_provider_pattern_in_react_using_react_context_api">[33]</a> as
this is the feature that comes out of the box with reactjs.</p>

<p><a class="citation" href="#post_four_patterns_for_global_state_with_react_hooks">[35]</a> says that
if the component needs to share more than two levels deep, the recommended approach is to use reactjs context. <a class="citation" href="#post_angularjs_patterns_in_react">[36]</a> uses
the provider/context pattern to implement a translation engine.</p>

<h3 id="hooks">Hooks</h3>

<p>Hooks are the highlight feature introduced in reactjs 16.8, mainly
focused in sharing logic between components and no class syntax, instead,
a functional approach is the preferred way<a class="citation" href="#reactjs_hooks_release">[37]</a><a class="citation" href="#post_react_hooks_design_patterns_creating_components_without_class">[38]</a>.
<a class="citation" href="#post_best_practices_with_react_hooks">[39]</a> gives a
introduction followed with reactjs hooks best practices, the material
is recommended to any level of developer that wants to understand hooks,
or for any developer that already knows hooks, it can be  a refresher. <a class="citation" href="#post_reusable_code_in_react">[40]</a> also states that hooks replace the mixins pattern for sharing code.</p>

<p><a class="citation" href="#post_how_advanced_react_patterns_changed_with_hooks">[27]</a> depicts
the difference between class components and functional components with
hooks and th benefits of using it. <a class="citation" href="#post_patterns_for_data_fetching_in_react">[25]</a> and <a class="citation" href="#post_5_react_data_fetching">[26]</a>
compares fetching data between the class approach and the functional approach with hooks, however
<a class="citation" href="#post_implementing_the_container_pattern_using_react_hooks">[10]</a> refactor
the container pattern using the class style with hooks.</p>

<p><a class="citation" href="#post_the_facade_pattern_and_applying_to_react_hooks">[41]</a> integrates
the facade design pattern into a javascript implementation, and then
combines the pattern with reactjs hooks. <a class="citation" href="#post_production_level_patterns_for_react_hooks">[42]</a> builds
a to-do app using hooks and uses a folder name called models to store
custom hooks, and tries to relate this structure with the MVC pattern.</p>

<p><a class="citation" href="#post_react_hooks_rebirth_of_state_management">[43]</a> and <a class="citation" href="#post_a_state_management_pattern_for_ionic_react">[44]</a>
focus on the state management. <a class="citation" href="#post_react_hooks_rebirth_of_state_management">[43]</a> dives
in mocking the redux implementation using hooks. The approach used
is interesting for learning purposes. Therefore, the implementation
for both authors are simplifications over a more complex implementation
of redux. The benefits of implementing those state managements by hand
comes with a drawback. Redux on the other hand is more complex, but
it is a standard for state management, having a wide community that
created different libraries to work with it (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">redux-offline</code>).</p>

<p>Finally, <a class="citation" href="#post_bloc_pattern_with_react_hooks">[45]</a> converts
the BLoC pattern to be used with reactjs. The BLoC pattern was created
to share code between flutter and angular dart.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>ReactJs is among the most used UI libraries, as a result it has a lot of
content created by the community and by Facebook (which is the company behind
rectJS). The proposed study showed the most used reactjs patterns as well as
the themes that surround the patterns. As it tuns out, the most popular patterns
are components and props, which are the reactjs foundation and not advanced
patterns for experienced reactjs developers. On the other hand, patterns
like Higher order components, hooks and container component requires some previous
knowledge to be used effectively, but those patterns that require
more experience are the ones less popular as well.</p>
